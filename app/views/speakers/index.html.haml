He used to tutor people while he was still in school, helping out fellow students whenever he had the chance. It wasn't that weird that after a few years of professional experience, he ended up teaching class. He has trained and coached several teams on different subjects, ranging from process oriented topics like scrum, kanban and effective collaboration through gamestorming to more technical focused topics like test automation, test driven development and software craftsmanship principles.

        Steven began his career as enterprise software developer, working with C, C++ and Visual C++ for about 6 years. After a brief period as DBA, in 2004 Steven started working in the world of web applications. There he played a pioneering role in Flex and AIR, resulting in a long term close relationship with Adobe as Adobe Certified Instructor and Adobe Community Professional. In 2011 he became the unit manager for an Adobe Authorised Training Centre in Belgium, managing a team of 7 highly skilled professionals. In 2012, Steven took a leap of faith and founded his own company Silver Lining (http://www.silver-lining.be), with the intention to combine the training aspect with consultancy in project, process and change management. With this goal in mind he started focusing on Lean Six Sigma, becoming a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt and applying these techniques to an IT environment. In his spare time (when that occasionally happens) Steven likes to read up on scientific articles in several areas. When he&#39;s not behind his computer, you can find him spending quality time with his wife and kids.

        Jurgen De Smet started to really learn (read: out of school) since 1996 within Software Development environments, starting out as a monkey in a small company filling his days with installations, upgrades, bug fixing & integration development… dealing with other species as customers, end-users, other suppliers provided great insight into the jungle we work. From that moment on he could not longer be the monkey and somehow started to mutate to a gorilla (team lead), king-kong (group lead) to one of the lions around (R&D Manager) expanding his territory of knowledge, learning from other jungles and finding better ways to survive while changing the environments from a jungle to a commune of transparency, trust, effectiveness and collaboration among all species around.

        Being busy with change since 2001 in different jungles, having met with over a 100 of different species, we could call Jurgen a chameleon with a huge backpack of knowledge, technique’s and frameworks to support other lions out there to do just enough of the right thing at the right time and be respected for it.

        After more than 5 years working as a software development and architecture consultant for others, in January 2011 I won the first Startup Weekend in Brussels and that event was the kick-in-the-butt I needed to start my own business. Plus, the Startup Weekend introduced me to Lean Startup techniques for the first time and it gave me hope as to my chances of success and it gave me the tools I needed to shape my ideas. Today, after almost 3 years using Lean Startup techniques, both on my projects and as a coach for others, I learned one or two things that I would love to pass along to fellow developers who are thinking of bringing their own ideas to life, but are hesitant to.
