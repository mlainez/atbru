        I am an Agile Coach, passionate about helping organizations in implementing change strategies focused on Agile / Lean and a culture of continuous improvement. With a background in project management and business analysis, I became actively involved with Agile / Scrum over 5 years ago and have since worked within large Agile change initiatives. Acting as either a Product Owner or a Scrum Master, I helped software development teams improve their relationship with customers, as well as their ability to deliver value every Sprint. In the last 2 years I have been working as an Agile Coach, helping small and large organizations in their Agile change initiatives. I'm currently working as an Agile Coach at Belgacom, where I am helping to lead the Enterprise Scrum initiative. I'm actively involved with the Agile community in Europe and am interested in helping to explore Agile theories and practices, and how they can address the challenges faced by organizations today.
