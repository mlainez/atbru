      ### What's Agile Tour Brussels?

      Agile Tour Brussels ([http://www.atbru.be](http://www.atbru.be)) is one of the biggest agile conferences in Belgium. Last year we gathered 180 attendees and speakers from Belgium, France, U.S, U.K, Luxemburg, Netherlands and Sweden to share our passion for Agile. The purpose of this conference is to gather in one place Agile practitioners and people wanting to know more about Agile.
      At Agile Tour Brussels you will meet a mix of attendees who are either completely **new** to Agile, experienced or **experts**.

      This year we're going to have different tracks, and for each of these
      we're looking for two kind of sessions: IInteractive **Talk** (Presenter is
      speaking for most of the time with audience interaction) or **Workshop**
      (Primarily focused on hands-on participation with the audience).



      ### Track 1: Experience reports.

      Tell us your success or failure stories about Implementing Agile in Belgium (or in Europe), What is (not) working for you? If you're an agile coach or facilitator, bring your client with you!

      ### Track 2: Pragmatic Track

      We’re looking for small changes or fundamentals, pragmatic things that work. How do you gather requirements? How do you run an outstanding retrospective? In this track your participants will learn something they can apply the day after.  It can be technical, soft-skills or a process you use.

      ### Track 3: Let's Play together

      This Track is for Agile Games and Serious Games. It's also the opportunity to suggest "BootCamp" sessions like Introduction to \[put Agile method here\] or how to estimate with Agile,...

      ### Track 4: Agile Management

      What's the role of Managers in Agile? What's an Agile Manager? What's an Agile organization? This track will cover subjects such as Management 3.0, Flat organizations, Evidence Based Management,...

      ### Track 5: Various

      Do you have a favourite subject you'd like to talk about, a kick-ass workshop you'd like to run, a theme you'd like to share? This track is for you!

      **All Agile methods are welcome**: Scrum, XP, KanBan, Lean, Devops, Leadership, Lean Startup, Coaching, System thinking, Product Aspect, Agile outside IT,

      We are looking for **different levels** of sessions: for beginners, practitioners and experts. We welcome experienced as well as new speakers.
