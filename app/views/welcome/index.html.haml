      ### What's Agile Tour Brussels?

      Agile Tour Brussels ([http://www.atbru.be](http://www.atbru.be)) is one of the biggest agile conferences in Belgium. Last year we gathered 180 attendees and speakers from Belgium, France, U.S, U.K, Luxemburg, Netherlands and Sweden to share our passion for Agile. The purpose of this conference is to gather in one place Agile practitioners and people wanting to know more about Agile.
      At Agile Tour Brussels you will meet a mix of attendees who are either completely **new** to Agile, experienced or **experts**
  
      If you have any questions, feel free to drop an email at [bruno@atbru.be](mailto:bruno@atbru.be)
      If you cannot make it, you can still support us by tweeting about #atbru, blogging, speaking about our event.

      Thanks in advance for your support!

      The Agile Tour Brussels Organization Team.
